1) "I am experiencing Prisma errors when trying to recreate the DB migration"
2) after adapting the migration file everything works and the candidates are being properly added, so I could continue
3) "from the mermaid schema, please create the associated SQL script for an initial migration"
4) "I realized that I had already created the first Prisma migration, which is @migration.sql. please, in order to add the possibility to create HR-recruiters. this new entity can have relation with many candidates, and each candidate can be hired by only one recruiter. expand the entities and DB relationships as you consider to get it"
5) "I want you to create the needed backend and frontend parts and explain me how to proceed with the new migration"
6) "have you changed frontend port? I want to access from localhost 3000 port and hace all my features with candidates and recruiters there"
7) "why are you using angular? i want to use react as the frontend was initially. please revert every angular change and use the frontend base to add the recruiters part"
8) "please revise all the code because there are multiple errors"
9) "multiple errors in chrome while executing frontend"
10) "please check the errors when executing 'npm run build' in the backend"
11) "lots of errors while executing npm start in frontend"
12) "no additional features, just check that there are no angular remainings and that the frontend executes properly"
13) "why have you created a recruiter folder within src in backend? recruiter is just another bonded context, distribute backend according to ddd and clean architecture paradigms and continue with the docker compose after it"
14) MANY error messages
